# Problem Description
In this project task is to identify major themes/topics across a collection of BBC news articles. One can use clustering algorithms such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) etc
I used LDA.
## Data Description
The dataset contains a set of news articles for each major segment consisting of business, entertainment, politics, sports and technology. One need to create an aggregate dataset of all the news articles and perform topic modeling on this dataset. 
Verify whether these topics correspond to the different tags available.
The problem that we would like to talk about here is to find the best segregation of documents according to their topics. This kind of separation can be used for assigning a topic to a document (which is called topic labeling) or for general determination of compressed characteristics of a huge text data set.
### End Note
From the comparative analysis made, it has been observed that the topic modeling approaches find the hidden topics and relationship betweenwords and documents with multiple probability distributions.As a future work, using one of the topic modeling algorithms, we can implement various applications for recommending research articles, analyzing news articles etc, which can be used for segregation of documents from top
